COVID 19 Data Exploration and Analysis - An SQL approach

The Covid-19 pandemic was one of the deadliest outbreaks in modern history, significantly impacting both public health and the global economy. Public communication will play a critical role in creating awareness among the public and government officials, helping to make decisions that could mitigate the spread, provide aid, and plan for economic recovery.

Objective of the Study: 
Glean valuable insights into the pandemic's progression by analyzing the infection rates, mortality trends, and vaccination coverage drives globally.

✔ A comprehensive dataset of COVID-19 spread and vaccination drive spanning from Jan 2020 to Apr 
 2021 across the globe was retrieved from "OurWorldinData.org" published by Mathieu et al., 2020.
 
✔The dataset contained 0.3M+ records and 60+ attributes providing details on cases, infections, 
 deaths, and vaccinations.
 
✔The dataset was divided into two tables with Excel: "CovidDeaths" and "Covid_Vaccinations" and stored in Database named "Project portfolio".
  - Covid_Deaths dataset contained columns and records on cases and deaths.
  - Covid_Vaccinations dataset contains columns and rows regarding vaccinations and tests. 
 
✔Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio was used for data cleaning and data analysis.

✔Advanced SQL functions and techniques were used to query the dataset. These included JOINS, 
 Subqueries, Common Table Expressions, Aggregate and Window Functions, Views, Temp Tables, etc.
 
✔Identified key patterns in pandemic's progression across 200+ countries.

✔Developed detailed reports and visualisations to track changes in infection rates, resulting in a 10% 
 increase in data-driven decision-making for public health interventions.
